## Structure

Dependencies are stored in package.json.

The most important file for understanding the structure of the template is server.js. This is where the actual Express app object is created, where the middlewares and routes are registered, and more. To register a routefile, follow the pattern established here with exampleRoutes and userRoutes. If you want to add any middlewares to your app, do that here.

The app directory contains models and route files. Models are simply Mongoose models. To create your own, follow the patterns established in app/models/example.js. Route files are somewhat similar to controllers in Rails, but they cover more functionality, including serialization and deciding which HTTP verbs to accept and what to do with them.

The config directory holds just db.js, which is where you specify the name and URL of your database.

The lib directory is for code that will be used in other places in the application. The token authentication code is stored in lib/auth.js. The other files in lib deal with error handling. custom_errors.js is where all the different custom classes of errors are created. If you need some other kind of error message, you can add it here. There are also some functions defined here that are used elsewhere to check for errors. lib/error_handler.js is a function that will be used in all your .catches. It catches errors, and sets the response status code based on what type of error got thrown.

You probably will only need to interact with files in app/models, app/routes, and server.js. You'll need to edit db/config.js just once, to change the name of your app.
